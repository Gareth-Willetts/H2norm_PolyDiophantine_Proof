# H2norm_PolyDiophantine_Proof

Authors: Timothy H. Hughes and Gareth H. Willetts

Contains code to accompany the paper "Efficient fraction-free computation of the ùêª2 norm via the polynomial
Diophantine equation: proof of algorithm" by Timothy H. Hughes and Gareth H. Willetts (in review).

The aforementioned paper describes and proves a new fraction-free algorithm for computing the H2 norm via the polynomial Diophantine equation. Please refer to the paper for pseudo-code defining the algorithm, and its logical proof. This code is provided to test specific examples and to provide an implementation in Matlab.
